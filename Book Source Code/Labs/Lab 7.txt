The initial limiter on the size of the packet was the buffer size. If I set the buffer size to 512, the length would obviously be 512. By increasing the buffer size gradually (and then by extreme measures), I eventually came to the largest packet length of 65507. After that, the udp packets would not be picked up by wireshark, so I am assuming that they are unable to send (not enough room for the ip address or frame formatting).
